Please find enclosed your project listing annotated with comments
about coding style.  Please consider this feedback as you complete
Project 2.

I apologise for the lateness of this feedback.  We ran into some
difficulty getting all the submissions marked promptly.

In summary, you received  70 / 70 marks for correctness
and quality of guesses (the objective assessment), and  22 / 30
marks for code quality.  Your submission was 0 hours late,
with an extension of 0 hours, incurring a penalty of 0%.
This all gives you

    92.000000% 

for this project.  This will be scaled to the value of the project.

We assessed your code quality according to these criteria, leading to
your  22 / 30 marks for code quality:

  3 / 5  Quality of file-level documentation, including authorship

  4 / 5  Quality of function- and type-level documentation

  3 / 5  Readability of code (lines not wrapped, good, consistent
         layout, no redundant comments)

  4 / 5  Understandability of code (good choice of names,
         subtleties documented, well organised)

  4 / 5  Appropriate abstraction (no chunks of repeated code; no
         really long functions, good types

  4 / 5  Good use of language and libraries

These assessments reflect the annotations in the accompanying program
listing.

Each of these criteria was assessed on this 0-5 scale:

    5 = practically flawless
    4 = very good, but not perfect
    3 = passable, but not great
    2 = unsatisfactory, but on the right track
    1 = very poor
    0 = no effort


For correctness and guess quality, you received:

  10 / 10  Correctness of your feedback function

  20 / 20  Correctness of your guessing for 2-card targets

  30 / 30  Quality of your guessing for 2-card targets

  5 /  5  Correctness of your guessing for 3- and 4-card targets

  5 /  5  Quality of your guessing for 3- and 4-card targets
